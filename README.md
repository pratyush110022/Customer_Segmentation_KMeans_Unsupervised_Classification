# Unsupervised Classification for Customer Segmentation

## Description

This project leverages unsupervised learning techniques to segment customers based on their spending behavior and annual income. Using K-Means clustering, the project identifies distinct customer groups by analyzing their `Annual Income (k$)` and `Spending Score (1-100)`. 

## Key Components

- **Data Analysis**: Exploration and preprocessing of customer data to prepare for clustering.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Application of the K-Means algorithm to group customers into clusters based on their financial and spending attributes.
- **Visualization**: Use of Seaborn and Matplotlib to create scatter plots that illustrate the clusters and their centers. These visualizations help in understanding the distribution of customers and the characteristics of each cluster.
- **Cluster Interpretation**: Analysis of cluster characteristics to derive meaningful insights and labels for each customer segment.

## Objectives

- **Segment Customers**: Identify different customer segments to tailor marketing strategies and business decisions.
- **Visualize Results**: Provide clear and informative visualizations to understand customer distribution and cluster centers.
- **Generate Insights**: Offer actionable insights based on customer behavior patterns to drive strategic decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib**: Data visualization tools for plotting and analyzing cluster results.
